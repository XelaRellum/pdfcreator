<p>From Version 0.8.1 RC9 the PDFCreator has a COM Interface included. So it is  possible to control the PDFCreator using the command line of any other  application.<br />Nearly all possiblities of the program are available using the  COM Interface. The COM Interface includes Public  classes, Public properties, Public methods and Public  events.<br />There are no UDTs used so the compalibility will not be broken  with any upgrading of UDTs.<br />There are &quot;self-documenting&quot; names used so that  no further description is needed.<br /><br />If the COM Interface should be tested  in server mode. All settings have to saved with function <em>cSaveOptions</em>  or the changes will have no effect.<br /><br />In the sub-directory &quot;COM&quot; (located  in the PDFCreator folder), several examples for different programming languages  can be found that will demonstrate the procedure.</p>
