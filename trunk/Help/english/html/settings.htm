    <td class="main"><p class="header">Settings in PDFCreator</p>
      <p>Since version 0.8.1 RC8, PDFCreator saves all settings in the registry. 
        If you choose the "Standard installation" PDFCreator saves settings to 
        the following registry location: <em><strong>HKCU\Software\PDFCreator</strong></em>
      <p>If your operating system is Windows 2000 and above, the setup saves some settings
        for the default user in the following registry location:
        <em><strong>HKU\.DEFAULT\Software\PDFCreator</strong></em> <br>
        <br>
        In a "Server installation" of PDFcreator,  the settings are saved to the following
        registry location: <em><strong>HKLM\Software\PDFCreator</strong></em> <br>
        <br>
        While the default location for settings is in the registry, it is also possible to
        store the settings in the the old .ini files mode. In this case PDFCreator save all
        settings to ini files. It is also possible to add an external ini file as default file.
        For more information use the commandswitch /? on the setup program. <br>
        <strong>Attention:</strong> There exists some problems with server based profiles and
        if the application data path is on a network drive. Because of this case server installations
        can't use the old ini-mode. <br>
        <br>
        If you choose the "Standard installation" and are saving to ini files, the settings are saved
        to the application data path of user: <br>
        <em>Example:</em> C:\Documents and Settings\[user profile]\Application Data\PDFCreator <br>
        <br>
        If your operating system is Windows 2000 and above, the setup saves some settings for the
        default user in the following directory: <br>
        <em>Example: </em>C:\Documents and Settings\Default User\Application Data\PDFCreator <br>
        <br>
        In a "Server installation" of PDFCreator, settings are saved in the followind directory:<br>
        C:\Documents and Settings\All User\Application Data\PDFCreator <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Procedure of reading the settings</strong>      
      <p>On Windows 2000 and above, PDFCreator reads the settings from the default user first. If there
        are no settings, PDFCreator will use its internal default settings. Next, PDFCreator reads
        the settings from the user. Only the user settings PDFCreator finds will overwrite the settings
        from the default user. Finally, PDFCreator looks for machine settings in <br>
        <em>HKLM\Software\PDFCreator</em> <br>
        or <br>
        <em>C:\Documents and Settings\All User\Application Data\PDFCreator</em>.<br>
        Only the machine settings PDFCreator finds will overwrite the settings from the user. With this
        behaivour it is possible for administrators to define settings for all users.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Procedure of saveing the settings </strong>     
      <p>If you choose the "Standard installation" of PDFCreator, settings are saved to either of the following: <br>
        <em>HKCU\Software\PDFCreator</em> <br>
        or <br>
        <em>C:\Documents and Settings\[user profile]\Application Data\PDFCreator </em><br>
        <br>
        If you choose the "Server installation" of PDFCreator, settings are saved to either of the following: <br>
        <em>HKLM\Software\PDFCreator </em><br>
        or <br>
        <em>C:\Documents and Settings\All User\Application Data\PDFCreator</em>      
      <p> <strong>Hint:</strong>&nbsp; If you need to use settings other than the default, use the /REGFile= or /INIfile= parameters on the installation program. For more information on the parameters that can be used on installation program, use the /? parameter.</td>
