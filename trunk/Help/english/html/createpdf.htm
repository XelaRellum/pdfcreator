      <p><strong><a name="printing"></a>Method 1: Printing</strong></p>
      <p><strong>1.</strong> Open the document you wish to convert into a PDF 
        in its default application.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>2.</strong> Print the document as you would on a standard printer.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>3.</strong> When the print dialog appears, change the printer 
        from your default printer to the <em>PDFCreator</em> printer. If the <em>PDFCreator</em> 
        printer is your default printer, you do not have to change it. Then click 
        OK.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>4.</strong> Another window will appear asking you to fill in some 
        information to create your PDF. Click on the Save button to pick the location 
        where you want to save the PDF or click the Waiting button to create the 
        PDF at a later time.</p>
      <ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is also the location where you can specify 
          what format you want to save the document in. You can save in PDF, PNG, 
          JPEG, BMP, PCX, TIFF, PS, and EPS format.</p>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>5.</strong> If you selected Save, your PDF will be created and 
        opened up in your default PDF viewer. If you selected Waiting, the PDFCreator 
        Print Monitor will open up with the document in the queue.<br>
        <br>

        the process has been completed.<br>
