<p>In all cases so far, these have been false alerts. We always check the files packaging them, but to make sure it is harmless you can check the mentioned file here:</p> <p>http://www.virustotal.com/</p> <p>Mostly, the file uninst000.exe is detected. The file is part of our installer system (called Inno Setup) which is used by a lot of programs. Some virus signature producers are a bit inattentive to these things and add them to the database when they are contained in a trojan horse, not regarding, that they could be contained in proper software as well.</p> <p>These false alerts normally disappear within few days. If you feel better anyway, you can keep the file in the quarataine for that time.</p>
