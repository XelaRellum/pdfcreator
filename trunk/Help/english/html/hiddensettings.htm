      <p>PDFCreator includes several hidden settings that are used for testing
        purposes. These default storage area for these features is in the registry.
        It is possible to store these settings in an .ini file. To store settings
        in an .ini file, you must start a new installation and use the /useINI
        parameter. If you need to use settings other than the default, use the
        /INIFile= parameters on the installation program. For more information
        on the parameters that can be used on installation program, use the /?
        parameter. </p>
      <p><strong>ClientComputerResolveIPAddress:</strong> In special cases is
        it possible that the token <em>&lt;ClientComputer&gt;</em> contains an
        IP-address instead a hostname. If you enable this feature, PDFCreator
        will try to resolve the IP-address into a hostname.<br>

        0 - Off (Default)<br>
        1 - On </p>
      <p><strong>DeviceWidthPoints, DeviceHeightPoints:</strong> These two settings
        set the desired width and height of the paper in points (units of 1/72
        of an inch). This is used as an alternative to the Papersize setting,
        not in combination with.<br>

      <p><strong>OnePagePerFile:</strong> This setting allows the user to create
        a new file for every page in the original document. Due to a restriction
        in Ghostscript, this does not work for PDF and EPS file formats.<br>

        </p>
     <p><strong>PDFCompressionColorCompression*, PDFCompressionGreyCompression*:</strong> With help of these parametres
        it is possible to set individual compression factors for each compression degree so the compression of colour and
        greyscale pictures can be controlled much better. All values must be greater than 0.<br>
        <em>Default values:</em><br>
         PDFCompressionColorCompressionJPEGMaximumFactor=2<br>
         PDFCompressionColorCompressionJPEGHighFactor=0.9<br>
