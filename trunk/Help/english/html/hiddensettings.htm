      <p>PDFCreator includes several hidden settings that are used for testing 
        purposes. These features can be found in the PDFCreator.ini file.</p>
      <p><strong>OnePagePerFile:</strong> This setting allows the user to create 
        a new file for every page in the original document. Due to a restriction 
        in Ghostscript, this does not work for PDF and EPS file formats.<br>
        <em>Properties: </em><br>
        0 - Off (Default)<br>
        1 - On</p>
      <p><strong>RunProgramAfterSaving:</strong> This setting allows the user 
        to launch a separate program after a document is saved using PDFCreator. 
        This is used in conjunction with the RunProgramAfterSavingProgramname 
        setting.<br>
        <em>Properties:</em><br>
        0 - Off (Default)<br>
        1 - On</p>

        program\my program.exe&quot;</p>
      <p><strong>RunProgramAfterSavingWaitUntilReady:</strong> This setting is 
        used in conjunction with the RunProgramAfterSaving setting. It allows 
        the user to specify whether or not PDFCreator waits until the program 
        is ready, or continues on to the next job/closes.<br>
        <em>Properties:</em><br>
        0 - PDFCreator doesn't wait and starts the next job, or close. (Default)<br>
        1 - PDFCreator waits until the program is ready.</p>
      <p><strong>RunProgramAfterSavingWindowstyle:</strong> This setting is used 
        in conjunction with the RunProgramAfterSaving setting. It allows the user 
        to specify the window style of the new program that is launched when a 
        document is created using PDFCreator.<br>

        6 - MinimizedNoFocus</p>
      <p><strong>RunProgramAfterSavingProgramParameters:</strong> This setting 
        is used in conjunction with the RunProgramAfterSaving setting. This allows 
        the user to specify any parameters for the new program that is being launched 
        with the RunProgramAfterSaving and RunProgramAfterSavingProgramname settings.</p>
      <p><strong>PDFOwnerPasswordString:</strong> This setting is used when security 
        is enabled for PDF documents. When used, PDFCreator will automatically 
        put in the password supplied in the PDFCreator.ini file for the owner 
        password. <em><strong>WARNING:</strong></em> text in the PDFCreator.ini 
        file is not encrypted. Use this feature at your own risk.</p>
      <p><strong>PDFUserPasswordString:</strong> This setting is used when security 
        is enabled for PDF documents. When used, PDFCreator will automatically

        a standard title on all documents created by PDFCreator.</p>
      <p><strong>StampString:</strong> When a text string is placed in this setting, 
        PDFCreator puts a &quot;stamp&quot; in the center of each page of the 
        document with that text. You can change the stamps font, color, size, 
        and outline by using the following settings. <strong><em>WARNING:</em></strong> 
        This setting is very experimental. When this setting is used, some pages 
        of the document can become corrupted. Make sure to check your PDF after 
        you create it.</p>
