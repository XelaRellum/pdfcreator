<p>Sometimes it happens, that the PDFCreator Setup will not install PDFCreator, as it detects a previous installation. This can be due to a aborted uninstalltion or a defect setup (shame on us in that case). You will then get the error message &quot;The program is installed already.<br /> For a new installation uninstall the program first&quot;.</p> <p>Sometimes it also happens, that other people have a look at our setup source code and copy interesting parts from it, which surely is ok and what open source is all about. But they do not change a setting, by which PDFCreator identifies itself. This can come to comflict then.</p> <p>To solve these problems, there is a setup parameter /ForceInstall which will ignore this setting, which should solve all these troubles.</p> <p>You can either start the setup through the command line (Start-&gt;Execute-&gt;&quot; /ForceInstall&quot;) or create a shortcut to the installer an add the Parameter in the properties.</p>
