      <p>The General Settings page sets the basic properties that the entire PDFCreator 
        application will use.</p>
      <p><strong>Associate PDFCreator with Postscript Files:</strong> When this 
        is clicked, PDFCreator becomes the default application for opening Postscript 
        (.ps) files in Windows. Do not click this if you have another program 
        that you wish to be the default instead.</p>
      <p><strong>Processpriority:</strong> The process priority determines how 
        much of your computer's processing power will go into creating the PDF 
        when you go to print. If changed, the speed at which PDFCreator creates 
        the new documents will increase or decrease. This can be useful on systems 
        with low resources.</p>
      <p><strong>No Confirmation on Temporary Changing to Default Printer:</strong> 
        Occasionally, PDFCreator is required to be the default printer to perform 
        some tasks. When checked, PDFCreator automatically changes itself to the 
        default printer temporarily to complete the task. When not checked, PDFCreator 
        will ask each time it is needed.</p>
      <p><strong>Integrate PDFCreator into Shell:</strong> When this button is 
        clicked, PDFCreator integrates itself with the Windows shell. When you 
        right-click on selected documents in Windows Explorer a new menu item 
        will appear called &quot;Create PDF with PDFCreator&quot;. This enables 
        the user to quickly convert documents to PDF without having to open the 
        document. Note that this functionality requires PDFCreator to be temporarily 
        assigned the default printer status.</p>
      <p><strong>Remove Shell Integration:</strong> When clicked, removes the 
        PDFCreator shell integration described above.</p>
      <p><strong>Print Test Page:</strong> Creates a sample PDF to test the PDFCreator 
        printer and drivers. This allows the user to make a PDF without having 
        to go into another program to test the application. This is especially 
        useful when troubleshooting PDFCreator on your system.</p></td>
