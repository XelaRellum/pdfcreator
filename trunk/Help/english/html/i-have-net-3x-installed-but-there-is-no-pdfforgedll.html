<p><strong>ATTENTION:</strong> This entry only applies for PDFCreator versions prior to 1.0. Since then, pdfforge.dll uses .Net 2.0 as iTextSharp has switched to that as well and we hope to have fewer problems on Vista /&nbsp;Windows 7 installations, as .Net 2.0 is shipped with them. The .Net Framework 2.0 will be installed with .Net version 2 to 3.5.</p><hr /><p>This is a bit tricky as .Net 2 and above do not include .Net 1.1.  Microsoft does not even preinstall .Net 1.1 on Vista and Windows 7 anymore. Please install the .Net 1.1 Redistributable and then reinstall PDFCreator. This will bring you the pdfforge.dll.</p>
