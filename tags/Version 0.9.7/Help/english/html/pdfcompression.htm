      <p>This menu changes the compression settings used on a PDF when it is created 
        by PDFCreator.</p>
      <p><strong>Compress Text Objects:</strong> When checked, PDFCreator compresses 
        text in documents to reduce the PDF file size.</p>
      <p><strong>Image Compression:</strong> As with Text objects, images can 
        also be compressed to reduce the file size of a PDF. There are three types 
        of images you may choose to compress: color images, grayscale images, 
        and monochrome images. Below are the settings for image compression:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Compression Type:</strong> Sets the type of compression to 
          be used when compressing image objects. There are several types of images 
          compression including JPEG and ZIP.</li>
        <li><strong>Resample:</strong> Sets how to resample the image when compressing 
          image objects. Resampling is when an image's pixel size is changes, 
          and therefore the amount of pixels that are used is changed. Resampling 
          reduces the file size of any graphic.</li>
        <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Sets the dpi, or dots per inch images 
          will have when compressed into a PDF.</li>
      </ul></td>
