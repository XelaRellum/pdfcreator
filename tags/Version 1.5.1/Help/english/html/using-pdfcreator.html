<p>There are two different types of installations you can use when you first           install PDFCreator. They are a standard installation and a server installation.           Below is some more information on both types.</p>        <p><strong>Standard Installation:</strong> A standard installation sets           up a standard printer for PDFCreator and allows that computer to create           PDF documents, Bitmap images, and Postscript files.</p>        <p><strong>Server Installation:</strong> A server installation sets up a           network printer for PDFCreator and allows computers on your network to           create PDF documents, Bitmap images, and Postscript files remotely. If           you use a server installation on a terminal server, make sure that you           do not install PDFCreator in application mode.<br />          <br />          With a server installation, you can use Auto-Save Mode to automatically           save documents to a specified directory with UNC-pathnames and/or filename           tokens (for more information, see Auto-Save Mode).           When using this feature, make sure the user has access rights to save           in the specified directory. <br />          <em>Example:</em> \\file1\users\&lt;Author&gt;\PDFs<br />          <br />          <strong>Note:</strong> When using a server installation, make sure to           create a share for the printer with user access rights belonging to yourself.           Also, make sure that at least one instance of PDFCreator is open. You           can install PDFCreator as a service by using the &quot;instsrv.exe&quot;           and &quot;srvany.exe&quot; tools from the resource kit of your Windows           installation. If you do install PDFCreator as a service, make sure to           use a user account with access rights writing in a Auto-Save directory.           Settings can only be changed on the server. Users cannot change any settings           in PDFCreator.</p>
