      <p>The General Settings page sets the basic properties that the entire PDFCreator 
        application will use.</p>
      <p><strong>Associate PDFCreator with Postscript Files:</strong> When this 
        is clicked, PDFCreator becomes the default application for opening Postscript 
        (.ps) files in Windows. Do not click this if you have another program 
        that you wish to be the default instead.</p>
      <p><strong>Processpriority:</strong> The process priority determines how 
        much of your computer's processing power will go into creating the PDF 
        when you go to print. If changed, the speed at which PDFCreator creates 
        the new documents will increase or decrease. This can be useful on systems 
        with low resources.</p>
      <p><strong>Print Test Page:</strong> Creates a sample PDF to test the PDFCreator 
        printer and drivers. This allows the user to make a PDF without having 
        to go into another program to test the application. This is especially 
        useful when troubleshooting PDFCreator on your system.</p></td>
