      <p><strong>Q: I have installed PDFCreator but it does not work, what should 
        I do?</strong></p>
      <p>A: Please check if a printer driver is installed. If not, try to uninstall 
        PDFCreator. Reboot and install it again. Reboot again and check if a printer 
        is installed. If not, check the SetupLog.txt in the PDFCreator directory. 
        If an error has occurred, then let us know in the forums at SourceForge.net 
        by clicking <a href="https://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=57796" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: The printer driver is not compatible with a policy enabled 
        on your computer that blocks NT 4.0 drivers</strong></p>
      <p>A: The error message you get is because of a Group Policy that by default 
        disallows installation of printers using kernel-mode drivers. Kernel-mode 
        drivers have access to system-wide memory, and poorly written drivers 
        can cause Blue Screens. To allow installation of these kind of drivers, 
        follow these steps:</p>
      <p>1. Click Start and then Run<br>
        2. Write gpedit.msc and press ENTER<br>
        3. Navigate to Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Printers 
        and change Disallow installation of printers using kernel-mode drivers 
        to Disabled</p>
      <p><strong>Q: Why does black text appear to be slightly grey?</strong></p>
      <p>A: The color model CMYK lets black text appear slightly grey though they 
        have a black level of 100%. To solve this set the color model to RGB in 
        the settings for PDF files.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: Does PDFCreator support program XYZ?</strong></p>
      <p>A: PDFCreator supports any program that is able to print via the standard 
        windows printer. The output will look as it is sent to the printer, which 
        normally is the way it looks on the screen.</p></td>
