      <p><strong>Q: What is the difference between the AFPL and the Ghostscript 
        version of PDFCreator?</strong></p>
      <p>A: The main difference is the Ghostscript version used. The AFPL version 
        is newer than the GPL version, but the license is more restrictive. If 
        you just want to use PDFCreator, then both versions are fine and the AFPL 
        should be prefered, as it is far better. If you need an aspect of the 
        license, that is not covered by the AFPL but by the GPL, then you should 
        download the GPL version.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: After installing PDFCreator I get an Error &quot;Exception 
        EInOutError in module is-XXXXX.exe at 0000631C. File not found&quot;. 
        What can I do?</strong></p>
      <p>A: This is a problem with old InstallShield installations which should 
        have been completed some time ago. In most cases you can safely delete 
        the file with the given filename from your windows directory. If you are 
        not sure if they are important, then move them to a backup folder.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: I cannot search/Copy &amp; Paste the text in my PDF file. 
        What ca I do?</strong></p>
      <p>A: This is a problem with a wrong printer driver installed by PDFCreator 
        0.7.1. Please uninstall PDFCreator, reboot and install the latest version.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: I have installed PDFCreator but it does not work, what should 
        I do?</strong></p>
      <p>A: Please check if a printer driver is installed. If not, try to uninstall 
        PDFCreator. Reboot and install it again. Reboot again and check if a printer 
        is installed. If not, check the SetupLog.txt in the PDFCreator directory. 
        If an error has occured, then let us know in the forums at SourceForge.net.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: The printer driver is not compatible with a policy enabled 
        on your computer that blocks NT 4.0 drivers</strong></p>
      <p>A: The error message you get is because of a Group Policy that by default 
        disallows installation of printers using kernel-mode drivers. Kernel-mode 
        drivers have access to system-wide memory, and poorly written drivers 
        can cause Blue Screens. To allow installation of these kind of drivers, 
        follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click Start and then Run</li>
        <li>Write gpedit.msc and press ENTER</li>
        <li>Navigate to Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Printers 
          and change Disallow installation of printers using kernel-mode drivers 
          to Disabled</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Q: Why does black text appear to be slightly grey?</strong></p>
      <p>A: The color model CMYK lets black text appear slightly grey though they 
        have a black level of 100%. To solve this set the color model to RGB in 
        the settings for PDF files.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: Does PDFCreator support program XYZ?</strong></p>
      <p>A: PDFCreator supports any program that is able to print via the standard 
        windows printer. The output will look as it is sent to the printer, which 
        normally is the way it looks on the screen.</p></td>
