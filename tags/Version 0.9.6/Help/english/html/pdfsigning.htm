      <p>The Security menu sets the PDF security settings to encrypt PDF documents 
        and disable many features for a more secure document.</p>
      <p><strong>Use Security:</strong> Enables or disables the security settings 
        in PDFCreator.</p>
      <p><strong>Encryption System:</strong> PDFCreator can use two different 
        encryption systems for its security. The first is built into Ghostscript 
        8.14 and greater. The second is PDFCreator's pdfenc system. Both provide 
        advanced security with password protection and encryption up to 128 bit.</p>
      <p><strong>Encryption Level:</strong> Encryption prevents unauthorized copying 
        of information contained inside of the PDF. PDFCreator can encrypt in 
        two levels: Low (40 bit) and High(128 bit). When an encryption level is 
        used, it restricts what versions of Adobe&reg; Acrobat&reg; can open the 
        PDF. To switch to the high security, make sure that your compatibility 
        is set to PDF 1.4 in the General tab of the PDF settings.</p>
      <p><strong>Passwords:</strong> With security, you can require a password 
        to view the document (user password) and to change permissions and passwords 
        (owner password). When checked, PDFCreator will ask for the passwords 
        for user and/or owner when it is in the process of creating the PDF.</p>
      <p><strong>Disallow User:</strong> This section enables the owner of the 
        PDF to set what the users of the document can do with it. The Owner can 
        disallow the user to print, copy text and images, modify the document, 
        and make or change comments.</p>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Permissions:</strong> These permissions are for 128 
        bit high security only. The owner can allow users to print in low resolution 
        only, fill in forms, screen readers, and changes to the assembly.</p></td>
