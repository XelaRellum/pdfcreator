      <p>To create a language file, open the Translation Tool from the PDFCreator 
        folder. A window appears with four columns. Below is a list of the columns 
        and what their function is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Section:</strong> This column tells the user what area of 
          the application the text is in. This column is strictly informational 
          and is not changeable.</li>
        <li><strong>Key:</strong> This column tells the application where to place 
          the text in the program. This column is strictly informational and is 
          not changeable.</li>
        <li><strong>EnglishText:</strong> This column contains the english text 
          that you will be translating into other languages. This column is not 
          changeable.</li>
        <li><strong>TranslatedText:</strong> This column is where you will place 
          the translated text for your language. When you click on a row, a small 
          box will appear so you can enter your text.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are 330 different keys to translate in PDFCreator. Once all the 
        keys have been translated, save the file to the languages folder in the 
        PDFCreator program folder. The file should be saved as a .ini file.</p></td>
