<p>This menu changes the compression settings used on a PDF when it is created           by PDFCreator.</p>        <p><strong>Compress Text Objects:</strong> When checked, PDFCreator compresses           text in documents to reduce the PDF file size.</p>        <p><strong>Image Compression:</strong> As with Text objects, images can           also be compressed to reduce the file size of a PDF. There are three types           of images you may choose to compress: color images, grayscale images,           and monochrome images. Below are the settings for image compression:</p>        <ul>          <li><strong>Compression Type:</strong> Sets the type of compression to             be used when compressing image objects. There are several types of images             compression including JPEG and ZIP. For JPEG compression, you can also set the compression level. A high compresseion reduces the file size, but also reduces the quality of the images. When set to manual, you can enter a compression factor to optimize the size/quality ratio.</li>          <li><strong>Resample:</strong> Sets how to resample the image when compressing             image objects. Resampling is when an image's pixel size is changes,             and therefore the amount of pixels that are used is changed. Resampling             reduces the file size of any graphic.</li>          <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Sets the dpi, or dots per inch images             will have when compressed into a PDF.</li>        </ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
