<p>You can define multiple profiles. Each profile has a given set of settings that define the settings for the output file and what is done with it (print after saving, calling actions etc.)</p><p>To learn more about the available options, please refer to the other sections of this chapter.</p><h3>Managing Profiles</h3><p>You can add and delete profiles using the plus (+) and cross (x) buttons and rename an existing profile. Yo can also load and save profiles from external files, to share them with other users.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> It is not possible to delete a profile, that is currently associated with a printer. You have to remove the association in the printer management window before it can be deleted.</p>
