<p>Translating PDFCreator is quite easy. Each language of PDFCreator is stored in an INI file, which contains a name for each string and the translated value<span style="font-family: monospace;">.</span><code><br /> </code></p> <table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0" style="width: 396px; height: 91px;"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffcc"><p><em>Beispiel:</em><br />...<br /><strong>Document=D&amp;okument<br />DocumentAdd=Hinzufügen</strong><br />...</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;<em>(Remark: The Ampersand (&amp;) Defines the following character as Keyboard shortcut for Menu items.)</em></p> <p>To make translating even easier, there is a tool called TransTool installed with PDFCreator, which allows you to see all english strings and to translate them into your language.<br /> You also have an overview which strings are missing, which is quite useful when you are updating your translation for the latest version.<br /> The string 'Author' is used to give you the credit for the translation, so you should place your name there.</p> <p>To make a translation publically available for everyone, just send us a quick mail that you have a translation, then we will give you access to the upload system.</p> <p>The language files need to be updated once in a while, when there are new features in PDFCreator. We will send notices on that as soon as possible prior to a release to enable as much translations as possible to be integrated in the setup.</p> <p>In some cases there might be a little more to do. If the Setup has no translation file for your language, then you could also translate the setup if you want to. Check if your <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/files/istrans/" target="_blank">language is available</a>.</p>
