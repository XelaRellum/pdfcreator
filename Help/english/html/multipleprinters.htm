<p>PDFCreator allows you to have multiple printers. In the Main Window, you can access the printer settings via Printer -&gt;&nbsp;Printers.</p><h3>Add/Delete a printer</h3><p>You can use PDFCreator to add new printers. These printers are no ordinary printers, but designed for the usage with PDFCreator. Just type in a printer name and click on &quot;Add printer&quot;. After selecting a printer, you can remove it by clicking on &quot;Del printer&quot;. This will add/remove real Windows printers.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>You need to have Administrator privileges to add or delete printers. On Windows Vista and above, you also have to run PDFCreator as Administrator.</p><h3>Link a printer to a profile</h3><p>You can link each printer with an option profile. You could have one printer for invoices that saves the invoice as PDF to a certain folder and another one for standard usage.</p><p>Other possibilities are:</p><ul><li>a JPEG image printer</li><li>high res PDFs for printing</li><li>low res PDFs for eMail</li><li>a PDF printer with predefined Author, Security Settings etc</li></ul><p>To learn how to use profiles, please have a look at the &quot;Using Profiles&quot; Section.</p>
