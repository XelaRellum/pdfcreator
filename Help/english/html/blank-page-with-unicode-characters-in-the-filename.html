<p>Using Unicode characters in the Title or file name will result in errors and may leave a PDF with a blank page.</p><p>The current version of PDFCreator is developed with Visual Basic 6. The user interface controls do not support unicode strings. Due to this, PDFCreator can only display Chinese characters on an English operating system, if the program font and the code page are set apropriately. But even then there are problems converting the strings (i.e. Title or filename) to the internal representation.</p>    <p>This was one the reasons, why we have to decided to redevelop PDFCreator on the .Net platform. In .Net, the controls fully support unicode and we don't have problems handling Chinese characters on any operating system.</p>
