<p>The general settings tab of the PDF settings menu allows the user to           modify some basic settings when creating a PDF.</p>        <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Sets what version of the PDF format to           use when converting a document into a PDF. The version corresponds to           what version of Adobe&reg; Acrobat&reg; the PDF can open in.</p>        <p><strong>Auto-Rotate Pages:</strong> When used, automatically rotates           horizontal pages to vertical and vertical pages to horizontal. You can           choose to have the entire document rotates or just a single page.</p>        <p><strong>Resolution:</strong> Sets the dpi or dots per inch of the PDF.           The higher the resolution the more detail the PDF will have and the larger           the file size of the PDF will be.</p>        <p><strong>Overprint:</strong> Overprint is when one color is intentionally           printed on top of another color without blending. When creating a PDF           you have the option of having overprint on or off. When overprint is off           it is called Non-Zero Overprint and when it is on it is called Full Overprint.</p>        <p><strong>Convert binary data to ASCII85:</strong> When checked, converts           any binary data a document may contain to ASCII 85 data.</p>        <p><strong>Fast web view:</strong> When this setting is used, PDFCreator will          optimize its PDF's for fast web viewing. Instead of the entire PDF document          being downloaded before being displayed, it will display it as it is downloaded.          Encryption cannot be used when this setting is enabled. If you do use          encryption, the PDF is not optimized.</p>
